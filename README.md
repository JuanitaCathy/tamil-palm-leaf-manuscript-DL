This paper focuses on the recognition of Tamil manuscript characters using a deep learning-based approach. Tamil, one of the world's oldest classical languages with 256 characters, contains a complex script with compound characters, making handwritten character recognition challenging, especially in historical manuscripts where degradation, noise artifacts, and stroke irregularities affect readability. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning approach that combines manuscript character extraction with a ResNet-50-based classification framework. ResNet-50 is a deep learning model known for its skip connections that improve gradient flow and training efficiency. The model is trained on the HPL-Tamil dataset, achieving 96% accuracy, and tested on manuscript-extracted characters from the Mendeley Tamil Palm Leaf dataset, where it attains 92.38% accuracy. Preprocessing techniques such as CLAHE, adaptive thresholding, and character segmentation using the Watershed algorithm were applied to refine recognition. The results underscore the potential of deep learning in preserving Tamil manuscripts, useful for linguistic preservation and computational epigraphy.
